üåæ Crop Predict: Smart Farming Through Soil AnalysisOverviewCrop Predict is a web application designed to help farmers make data-driven decisions on optimal crop selection. By analyzing key soil and environmental parameters (N, P, K, pH, Rainfall, Temperature, and Humidity), the application uses a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to recommend the best crop for the given conditions.This project is built using a Flask (Python) backend for serving the ML model and a Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for the user interface. It also features multilingual support using the Google Cloud Translation API for dynamic prediction results.‚ú® FeaturesIntelligent Prediction: Uses a trained RandomForestClassifier (stored in crop_model.pkl) to suggest optimal crops.7 Key Parameters: Accepts inputs for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), pH, Rainfall, Temperature, and Humidity.Real-Time API Integration: Frontend communicates with a Flask API endpoint (/predict).Multilingual Support (i18n):Static UI elements are translated client-side using a JavaScript dictionary.Dynamic prediction results are translated server-side using the Google Cloud Translation API.üöÄ Getting StartedTo run this application, you need to set up both the backend (Python server) and the frontend (HTML files).PrerequisitesPython 3.8+Google Cloud Project (for Translation API authentication)1. Backend Setup (app.py & Model)The backend uses Python/Flask to load the .pkl model and handle prediction requests.Clone/Create Project Structure:/CropPredict

Google Cloud Authentication:Ensure the Cloud Translation API is enabled in your GCP project.Set up authentication for your environment (e.g., using a Service Account or running gcloud auth application-default login).CRITICAL: Update the PROJECT_ID variable in app.py with your unique Google Cloud Project ID.# Snippet from app.py
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id" # <--- **UPDATE THIS LINE**
PARENT = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}"
Run the Server:python app.py
The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.2. Frontend Setup (index.html & script.js)The frontend is a static page that communicates with the local Flask server.Open the HTML: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.Verify Endpoint: Ensure the script.js file is pointing to the correct local server address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict.üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure and LogicFileRoleKey Logicapp.pyPython Backend Server (Flask)Loads crop_model.pkl.
